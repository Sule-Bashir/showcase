# Code Canvas - AI Sketch to App Generator

## Overview

Code Canvas is an innovative AI-powered tool that transforms hand-drawn UI sketches into fully functional, responsive web applications. Built for The AI Championship Hackathon, it demonstrates the power of AI in accelerating development workflows and making app prototyping accessible to everyone.

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Sketch Analysis**: Upload hand-drawn UI sketches and get working web apps
- **Multiple App Templates**: Generates login screens, todo lists, e-commerce cards, and more
- **ElevenLabs Voice Explanations**: Real-time audio explanations of generated code
- **Responsive Design**: All generated apps work perfectly on desktop and mobile
- **Real-time Preview**: Instant live preview of generated applications

## How It Works

The application uses Raindrop AI for intelligent code generation from sketch analysis. When a user uploads a UI sketch, the AI analyzes the components and generates clean, functional HTML/CSS/JavaScript code. ElevenLabs Text-to-Speech provides voice explanations that help users understand the generated code structure and functionality.

## Technologies Used

- **ElevenLabs API**: Text-to-Speech for code explanations and user guidance
- **Raindrop AI**: Intelligent code generation and sketch analysis
- **Vultr Cloud**: Backend infrastructure and deployment
- **Flask Python**: Backend framework
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Frontend and responsive design
